def can_chain(dominoes):
    """
    Determine if the given dominoes can be arranged in a chain.

    A chain is a sequence of dominoes where the right number of one domino is
    the same as the left number of the next domino, and the chain forms a loop
    where the right number of the last domino is the same as the left number
    of the first domino.

    This function uses depth-first search to try all possible chains.

    Args:
        dominoes (list): A list of tuples representing the dominoes.

    Returns:
        list: A list of tuples representing the chain if one exists, or None if no chain exists.

    Examples:
        >>> can_chain([(1, 2), (2, 1)])
        [(1, 2), (2, 1)]

        """
        Perform depth-first search to find a chain.

        Args:
            chain (list): The current chain of dominoes.

        Returns:
            list: A list of tuples representing the chain if one exists, or None if no chain exists.

# My Understanding of the pattern --->
# It starts with the letter 'A' at the top and goes up to the input letter, then back down to 'A'. 
# Each row of the diamond has two same letters, except for the first and last rows which have one letter
# The letters are separated by spaces, and the number of spaces between the letters increases by two with each row 
# from the top to the middle, then decreases by two with each row from the middle to the bottom.

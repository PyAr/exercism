    Translate a text to Pig Latin.

    Pig Latin is a language game that children use to speak in code. 
    The rules to translate a word into Pig Latin are:

    - If a word begins with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), append "ay" to the end of the word.
    - If a word begins with a consonant, move it to the end of the word, and then append "ay".
    - If a word starts with "xr" or "yt", treat it as if it starts with a vowel.
    - If "y" comes after a consonant cluster, it makes a vowel sound (e.g., "rhythm" -> "ythmrhay").
    - If "u" follows a "q" that has been moved to the end of the word, it should also be moved (e.g., "quiet" -> "ietquay").

    Args:
        text (str): The text to be translated.

    Returns:
        str: The translated text.

    Examples:
        >>> translate("hello")
        "ellohay"
        >>> translate("apple")
        "appleay"

def convert(number):
    """
    Convert a number into a string that contains raindrop sounds corresponding to certain potential factors.

    A factor is a number that evenly divides into another number, leaving no remainder.
    The simplest way to test if one number is a factor of another is to use the modulo operation.

    The rules of raindrops are that if a given number:

    - has 3 as a factor, add 'Pling' to the result.
    - has 5 as a factor, add 'Plang' to the result.
    - has 7 as a factor, add 'Plong' to the result.
    - does not have any of 3, 5, or 7 as a factor, the result should be the digits of the number.

    Args:
        number (int): The number to be converted into a raindrop sound string.

    Returns:
        str: The resulting raindrop sound string.

    Examples:
        >>> convert(28)
        'Plong'
        >>> convert(30)
        'PlingPlang'
        >>> convert(34)
        '34'
